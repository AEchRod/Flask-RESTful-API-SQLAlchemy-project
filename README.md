# Flask-RESTful-API-SQLAlchemy-project

## Description 

A simple API using Flask and the Flask-restful library, which connects to database using SQLAlchemy and SQLite3 to see equity names/prices and save equities to a portfolio.
Created based on the project created in the <b> REST APIs with Flask and Python course </b> from Udemy.

This is the first time using a README file, Git to track changes and POSTMAN to test endpoints as they are created, so a steep learning curve!

## Installation/requirements

flask-restful, flask-jwt-extended, SQLAlchemy, SQLite3

## Notes

This first iteration was based on the outdated flask-jwt extension, it now includes the use of flask-jwt-extended to include features such as token refreshing, claims and callback.

Also looking to implement a version of it which is hosted in Heroku or AWS.
