# Flask-RESTful-API-SQLAlchemy-project

## Description 

A simple API using Flask and the Flask-restful library, which connects to database using SQLAlchemy and SQLite3 to see equity names/prices and save equities to a portfolio.


This is the first time using a README file, Git to track changes and POSTMAN to test endpoints as they are created.

## Installation/requirements

flask-restful, flask-jwt (flask-jwt-extended), SQLAlchemy, SQLite3

## Notes

This first iteration is based on the outdated flask-jwt extension, next version will include use of flask-jwt-extended to include features such as token refreshing, claims and callback.
